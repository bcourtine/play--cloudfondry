h1. Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry allows you to easily deploy your Play! application on "Cloud Foundry":http://www.cloudfoundry.com/ PaaS. If you bind a Cloud Foundry service to your instance (MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL), it will configure your Play DB connection for you.

h2. Usage

To use this module, you have to declare it in the dependencies file:

<pre><code>
require:
    - play
    - cloudfoundry -> 0.5
</code></pre>

If you work with a MongoDB database, you will have to add a MongoDB module: "Mongo":http://www.playframework.org/modules/mongo or "Morphia":http://www.playframework.org/modules/morphia.

Before deploying the application in Cloud Foundry, you must delete/comment your local DB configuration (db, db.url, morphia, etc.): if a DB config is present, the module will not override it.
